"""
Use POST APIs to create new resources. When talking strictly about REST, POST methods are used to create a
new resource into the collection of resources. Responses to this method are not cacheable unless the response
includes appropriate Cache-Control or Expires header fields. POST is neither safe nor idempotent. you can't use
this method more than once and expect a consistent outcome or result.

Ideally, if a resource has been created on the origin server, the response SHOULD be HTTP response code 201 (Created).
Many times, the action performed by the POST method might not result in a resource that can be identified by a URI.
In this case, either HTTP response code 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) is the appropriate response status.

    A request body is data sent by the client to your API in the message body. To declare one in FastAPI,
